# Skills Page Handoff

`/[locale]/skills` shows the full skills list with search and domain filters. It is what "Show all N skills" on Home links to.

See [[README]] for shared rules and files. Data: `skills` in `shared/content.ts`. Messages: the `SkillsPage` namespace.

## Scope and order

1. Static route: hero, section header, and the full list rendered on the server (sorted).
2. Filter panel and list layout.
3. `SkillsExplorer`, a client component that holds the query and domain in state and hides rows that don't match.
4. Optional: sync the filters to `?q=&domain=` so a filtered view can be shared.

## Layout

- **Hero**: label "Skills", h1 "Skills", intro "Everything I work with, rated from 1 to 10. Search or filter by domain."
- **Section header**: the mono label "All skills" on the left; the count on the right: "41 skills", or "N of 41" while filtering.
- **Tile**: one `card` with a `card-border` border, radius 24, padding 28.
  - **Desktop**: grid `240px | 1fr` with a 32 px gap.
    - The aside is sticky (`top: 20px`) with a right border in `card-border` and 24 px right padding. It holds the search, the "Domain" label and the domain chips.
    - The list is a 2-column grid with gaps of 18 × 32 px. Each row is a grid `132px | 1fr | 40px`: the name (500), the 10-segment bar (10 px tall, 3 px gaps) and "n/10" in mono 12 `muted-foreground`.
  - **Phone**: a flex column with a 14 px gap: search, chips (wrapping), rows. Each row has the name and "n/10" on one line, with the bar below (8 px, 3 px gaps).
- **Search**: a 44 px pill with a `background` fill, a `card-border` border and a search icon. The visually hidden label is "Search skills". Focus: `brand` border plus a 3 px ring at 25%. Matching is a case-insensitive substring.
- **Domain chips**: All 41 · Core 5 · Frameworks 4 · Frontend 19 · Tools 13. The count follows the name in mono at 70% opacity. Single select; the active chip uses `selected`.
- **Order**: level descending, then the `sort` field, then name.
- **Empty state**: "No skills match “{query}”." in `foreground-soft`.

## Accessibility

- Each row has `role="meter"` with `aria-valuemin="1"`, `aria-valuemax="10"`, `aria-valuenow` and an `aria-label` such as "React: level 9 of 10".
- The chips form a toggle group (`aria-pressed`, or the Base UI toggle group).
- Announce count changes politely: `aria-live="polite"` on the count.

Owner TODOs: real levels for all skills (only 5 are set; the rest are placeholder 6).
