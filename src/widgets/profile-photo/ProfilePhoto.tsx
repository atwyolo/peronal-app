 * Photo tile, the LCP element of the home page: square on mobile, fills its grid area on desktop.
 * `sizes` is the rendered image width, not the tile width: in a tall desktop tile `object-cover` scales the photo by
 * its height, so the 288px column needs a wider file (322px at 1280, 345px at 1024). From about 1440 the tile is wider
 * than tall and the column decides, so desktop takes the larger of the two. The same crop is why the photo is
 * anchored left: it brings the face to the middle of the tile. On mobile nothing is cropped sideways.
